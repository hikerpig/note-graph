Note Graph is a generic visualization JS lib designed to show the structure of the document space and the relations between each doc.

A handy tool for anyone who is interested in building a graph view for document spaces.

It depends on D3.js and [force-graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/force-graph), written in Typescript and can be used in the browser.

## üì¶ Usage

### (1) Use in html

Make sure runtime dependencies d3 and force-graph are loaded before constructing `NOTE_GRAPH.NoteGraphView`.

Open [this fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/hikerpig/3ed215um) to see how it look like.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Note Graph simple example</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.2.0/dist/d3.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/force-graph@1.35.1/dist/force-graph.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/note-graph@latest/dist/note-graph.umd.js"></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div id="note-graph-container"></div>
    <script>
      async function initGraphView() {
        const notes = await (
          await fetch(
            'https://note-graph.vercel.app/data/concept-data.json'
          )
        ).json()
        const graphModel = new NOTE_GRAPH.NoteGraphModel(notes)

        const graphView = new NOTE_GRAPH.NoteGraphView({
          container: document.getElementById('note-graph-container'),
          graphModel,
          enableNodeDrag: true,
        })
      }

      window.onload = function () {
