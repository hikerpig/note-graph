# Note Graph

Note Graph is a generic visualization tool designed to show the structure of the document space and the relations between each doc.

It aims to be a handy tool for anyone who's interested in building a graph view for document spaces.

It is based on D3 [force-graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/force-graph), written in Typescript and can be used in the browser.


Inspired by [Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam).
